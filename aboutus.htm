<p>&emsp;&emsp;THESEGAMES is an online games site started in duluth, MN. We are fairly new to the web but if you like our stuff feel free to keep coming back. The site will be updated every few weeks with new content. If you have a game request, leave it in the comments and we'll see what we can do. If you have a short story request, leave it in the comments as well, and we'll see what we can do. If YOU have written a short story and want us to post it, leave us your email in the comment box. If we get back to you it probably means we have chosen to post your story. We don't have time to go through every single request just to tell them all no. We can't meet everyones requests either so whether it's yours or not, it will be NEW content requested by SOMEONE. If it's not what you specifically requested, it's what someone somewhere HAS requested so don't get upset and please enjoy it.<p><font face = "TIMES NEW ROMAN" color = "BLUE">
